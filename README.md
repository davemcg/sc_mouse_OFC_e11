# sc_mouse_OFC_e11

Elan collected e11 mouse eye tissue. Shortly before (?) optic fissure closure. This is a prototype / test single cell experiment to see whether he can generate good quality scRNA data for this species / tissue / time point. 

# Some fissure-enriched genes:
Pax2 and Ntn1 are validated genes at the fissure margin.  Smoc2 is another gene shown to be at the fissure.  Vax1 also present in the fissure.
